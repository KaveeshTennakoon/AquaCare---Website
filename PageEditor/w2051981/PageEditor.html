              The Splash Screen welcomes users with a serene ocean-blue
              backdrop, showcasing our logo and mission statement. After a brief
              pause, it smoothly transitions to the Home page with a loader
              animation symbolizing progress. We prioritized cross-browser
              compatibility and accessibility, ensuring a captivating and
              seamless entry to our marine conservation platform.

            <h4>Task 2 - Shop</h4>
            <p>
              The Shop page offers a curated selection of products, blending
              functionality with a captivating user experience. Each item is
              beautifully showcased with high-quality images and enticing

              seamless integration, adding products to the cart dynamically
              updates the order summary. Robust form validation ensures accurate
              information capture during checkout, culminating in a delightful
              confirmation message upon completion. Leveraging HTML5, CSS3, and
              JavaScript, the Shop prioritizes cross-browser compatibility and
              adherence to web standards. It's more than an e-commerce platform;
              it's an immersive celebration of ocean beauty, empowering users to
              contribute to marine conservation through conscious purchases.

              The "Threats to Marine Life" content page highlights key
              challenges endangering ocean ecosystems. It covers topics such as
              pollution, overfishing, habitat destruction, climate change, and
              invasive species. Through concise text and visuals, it educates
              users about the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect
              marine biodiversity.
