      <h2>Content Page</h2>
      <p>
        The development of a web page focused on restoring mangroves involved
        the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Aligned with our website's
        theme, the page offers a brief introduction to the importance of
        mangrove conservation and actionable steps for restoration. HTML
        structured the layout, CSS enhanced visual aesthetics, and JavaScript
        facilitated interactive elements such as navigation buttons for seamless
        traversal. Embedded within the narrative are actionable strategies, each
        followed by a "back to top" button for easy navigation.
