      <h1>Threats to Marine Life</h1>
      <p>
        As we strive to achieve sustainability in our oceans and seas, it's
        crucial to understand the various threats that jeopardize marine
        ecosystems and the life they support. Here, we delve into some of the
        most pressing issues confronting marine life today.

          <h2>Climate Changes</h2>
          <p>
            Climate change poses an existential threat to marine life, with
            rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and changing weather
            patterns wreaking havoc on ecosystems worldwide. Coral bleaching,
            driven by elevated temperatures, endangers the survival of coral
            reefs and the multitude of species they support, while ocean
            acidification undermines the ability of marine organisms to build
            shells and skeletons, disrupting entire food webs.

          <h2>Pollution</h2>
          <p>
            Pollution, including plastic waste, oil spills, agricultural runoff,
            and chemical contaminants, presents a grave threat to marine
            ecosystems, imperiling the delicate balance of oceanic life.
            Plastics, pervasive in our oceans, pose a particularly dire risk, as
            marine life suffers from ingestion, entanglement, and habitat
            destruction.

          <h2>Overfishing</h2>
          <p>
            Overfishing, a consequence of unsustainable practices and increasing
            demand for seafood, jeopardizes marine ecosystems worldwide. It
            leads to the depletion of fish stocks and disrupts the delicate
            balance of marine food webs. This depletion not only threatens the
            survival of targeted species but also triggers cascading effects
            throughout the ecosystem.

          <h2>Habitat Destruction</h2>
          <p>
            Human activities like coastal development, dredging, and bottom
            trawling inflict severe damage on vital marine habitats like coral
            reefs, seagrass beds, and mangrove forests. These habitats serve as
            critical nurseries, feeding grounds, and shelters for numerous
            marine species. However, their disappearance due to habitat
            destruction leads to the loss of biodiversity and disrupts the
            delicate balance of marine ecosystems. Without these habitats, many
            species face extinction, and the resilience of marine ecosystems
            diminishes, exacerbating the threats they face.

          <h2>Invasive Species</h2>
          <p>
            The introduction of non-native species into marine environments
            poses significant challenges, as invasive species can rapidly spread
            and outcompete native organisms for resources, leading to ecosystem
            imbalance. Their unchecked proliferation often disrupts natural
            habitats, diminishes biodiversity, and compromises the resilience of
            marine ecosystems. Furthermore, invasive species can have
            far-reaching economic impacts, affecting fisheries, aquaculture, and
            tourism industries. Addressing the threats posed by invasive species
            requires comprehensive monitoring, management, and prevention
            measures to mitigate their detrimental effects and preserve the
            health and integrity of marine ecosystems.
